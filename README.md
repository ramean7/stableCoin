# Decentralized Stablecoin (DSC) System

## Overview

This project implements a **Decentralized Stablecoin (DSC)** system, designed to maintain a 1:1 USD peg using crypto-collateralized assets. The system is **overcollateralized**, algorithmically stable, and minimalistic, similar to MakerDAO‚Äôs DAI but without governance or fees.  

The core contract is [`DSCEngine.sol`](./DSCEngine.sol), which handles:

- Depositing and redeeming collateral (WETH, WBTC, or other allowed ERC20 tokens)  
- Minting and burning DSC tokens  
- Liquidating undercollateralized accounts  
- Maintaining health factor to prevent insolvency  

---

## Key Features

- **Dollar-Pegged:** DSC aims to maintain $1 value per token.  
- **Exogenously Collateralized:** Users deposit ERC20 tokens like WETH/WBTC as collateral.  
- **Overcollateralization:** Ensures system solvency. Collateral must always exceed minted DSC value.  
- **Liquidation Mechanism:** Undercollateralized positions can be liquidated with a bonus incentive.  
- **Secure Design:** Uses OpenZeppelin‚Äôs `ReentrancyGuard` and checks for zero amounts, allowed tokens, and health factor violations.

## Contracts

### DSCEngine.sol

This is the core contract controlling the DSC system. It integrates:

- **Collateral Management:** Deposit and redeem collateral tokens.
- **DSC Minting & Burning:** Safely mint and burn DSC tokens with health factor checks.
- **Liquidation:** Partial liquidation of undercollateralized users with bonus for liquidators.
- **Health Factor Calculations:** Ensures all users maintain minimum collateralization.

#### Important Constants

| Constant                     | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| `LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD`       | Collateral must be 200% of debt (50% threshold). |
| `LIQUIDATION_BONUS`           | Liquidators receive 10% bonus collateral. |
| `MIN_HEALTH_FACTOR`           | Minimum acceptable health factor (1e18). |
| `PRECISION`                   | Internal precision for calculations (1e18). |
| `ADDITIONAL_FEED_PRECISION`   | Used to normalize Chainlink price feeds (1e10). |

---

### DecentralizedStableCoin.sol

- ERC20 token representing the stablecoin.
- Minted and burned exclusively by the `DSCEngine`.
- 1 DSC = $1 USD (pegged).

## Usage

üè¶ Decentralized Stablecoin Engine (DSCEngine)

The DSCEngine is a decentralized stablecoin protocol that allows users to mint, burn, redeem, and liquidate a collateral-backed stablecoin (DSC). It leverages ERC20 tokens as collateral and Chainlink price feeds for secure and reliable on-chain valuations.

üöÄ Core Functions

1. Deposit Collateral and Mint DSC

dscEngine.depositCollateralAndMintDsc(tokenAddress, collateralAmount, dscAmount);

Users deposit ERC20 collateral and mint DSC against it.

2. Redeem Collateral for DSC

dscEngine.redeemCollateralForDsc(tokenAddress, collateralAmount, dscAmountToBurn);

Users burn DSC to unlock and redeem their collateral.

3. Burn DSC Without Redeeming Collateral

dscEngine.burnDsc(dscAmount);

Users can burn DSC directly to reduce debt without withdrawing collateral.

4. Liquidate an Undercollateralized User

dscEngine.liquidate(collateralToken, user, debtToCover);

If a user‚Äôs health factor falls below 1, they can be liquidated. Liquidators repay part of the debt and receive collateral at a discount.

üìä Health Factor

The health factor ensures that users maintain enough collateral:

healthFactor = (collateralValue * LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD) / totalDscMinted

healthFactor < 1 ‚Üí user can be liquidated

healthFactor >= 1 ‚Üí position is safe

ü™ô Collateral Tokens

Only approved ERC20 tokens can be used as collateral

Each collateral token must have a Chainlink price feed

Constructor:

constructor(address[] memory tokenAddresses, address[] memory priceFeeds, address dscAddress) {}

üîí Security Features

ReentrancyGuard ‚Üí protects deposits, withdrawals, and liquidations

Input Validation ‚Üí prevents zero amounts or unsupported tokens

Health Factor Enforcement ‚Üí disallows unsafe minting or redeeming
